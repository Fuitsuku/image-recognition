# First Image Processing Project

### Motivation
- I am currently taking a course on linear algebra and wanted to see a real-world application of what I am currently learning.
- Neural Networks are fascinating and I want to have more hands-on experiences working with it.
- The better I get at things, the more I enjoy them.

### Goals
- Understand how a picture gets converted into usable data for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Learn more about how image processing works from a conceptual standpoint and the libraries used during "it".
- Gain experience with Machine Learning Python Libraries.
